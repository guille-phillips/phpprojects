Sadness sings,
Reveal yourself!
Reveal yourself!
A faint remembered episode,
T'was a trick of self deception,
My surety dissolves with every blink,
The morning light hurts my every fibre,
I am sad for that night-time's bliss of ignorance!
Sad for the loss of my soul.
What joy in only being half awake?
Half a man?
Half a god?
